# Cafe Server-Client Application Repository

Welcome to the Cafe Server-Client Application repository!

This repository contains the codebase for a server-client application designed specifically for a cafe environment. The application facilitates communication between the cafe's server and clients, offering features tailored to the needs of both customers and staff.

### Key Features:
- **Order Management:** Clients can place orders, and the server efficiently manages and processes them.
- **Real-time Updates:** Clients receive real-time updates on the status of their orders.
- **Menu Display:** Clients can view the cafe's menu and make selections directly through the application.
- **Admin Controls:** Staff members have access to administrative controls for managing orders, inventory, and other aspects of cafe operations.

This project was developed as a requirement for the CS 222 course during the prelim term. Although this project has been submitted, I am still committed to improving this application to enhance my abilities.

Feel free to explore the codebase, contribute improvements, or provide feedback!
