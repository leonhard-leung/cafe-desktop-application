# Love & Latte Lounge Cafe Application Repository

Welcome to the **Love & Latte Lounge Cafe Application** repository!

This repository contains the codebase for a server-client application designed specifically for a cafe environment. The application facilitates communication between the cafe's server and clients, offering features tailored to the needs of both customers and staff.

### Key Features:
- **Order Management:** Clients can place orders, and the server efficiently manages and processes them.
- **Real-time Updates:** Clients receive real-time updates on the status of their orders.
- **Menu Display:** Clients can view the cafe's menu and make selections directly through the application.
- **Admin Controls:** Staff members have access to administrative controls for managing orders, inventory, and other aspects of cafe operations.

### To Be Added:
- **Database Implementation:** While the project currently utilizes XML for storing data, there are plans to transition to an SQL database for improved data management and scalability.
- **Networking Integration:** Implement networking functionalities to facilitate seamless communication between the server and clients over wider networks, enabling remote access and enhanced connectivity.

Feel free to explore the codebase, contribute improvements, or provide feedback!
